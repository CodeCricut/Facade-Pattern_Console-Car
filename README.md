# Console Car

Console Car is a simple console program that draws a car to the console based on a few factors. 

## Installation

Clone the project and run it in your editor of choice or the console.

## Summary

Console Car was meant to implement the facade pattern, but doesn't really that well. I figured truly implementing
the pattern would over complicate things. Instead, most conditions about the car have to be specified by their 
respective part (steering, doors, engine). You can specify whether the left or right door is open, whether the engine 
is on or off, or whether the car is turning left, right, or straight, and the car will be drawn accordingly.
